# Experiment 10: Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) with ESP32

---


## 🎯 Aim
To generate and control Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals using ESP32.

## Code Explanation
- PWM is used to control LED brightness by varying duty cycle.
- Method 1: Smooth fading effect.
- Method 2: Switches between different fixed brightness levels.

## 🔌 Connections
- **ESP32 Pin 5** → LED (with 220Ω resistor)
- **ESP32 GND** → LED GND
